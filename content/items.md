# Magic Items

## The Svirfneblin Bag of Crafts 
*Wondrous Item, common*

This bag contains a hefty supply for the crafty adventure. There are 3 different materials that can be pulled out of the bag, each of which can be pulled out once per day. All materials outside the bag lose all magic properties and effects at midnight. 
- **Glimmering Glitter**: You can toss a handful onto a creature or object within 5 ft. If it is a creature or an object being held by a creature, that creature must make a DC15 Dexterity Saving Throw. On a failure, the glitter will stick to the target, and the affected creature or object can’t benefit from being invisible. It takes an hour to remove the Glitter. 
- **Callarduran’s Smooth Glue**: You pull out a handful of glue, which isn’t sticky. When the command word is spoken, the glue immediately becomes sticky. Anything stuck together with this glue can be pulled apart with a successful DC 15 Strength check. 
- **Deep Dye**: You pull out a jar of dye of any one single color. The dye can stain any object, metal, leather, hair, skin, magical item… if you pour it, it will dye. It can be removed over ten minutes by continuously casting Prestidigitation. (Dye coloring does fade after midnight, like all other effects).

## Tactician's Ring
*Wondrous Item, common*

This ring made of jet and marble is proof that you know how to strategize when everything's on the line.
Once per day, you may activate this ring to use one of the following effects.
- **Castling**: It's time to reposition. Choose one willing creature you can see within 15 feet.  
    You may swap places with that creature as a bonus action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If your movement speed is currently 0, you may not use this effect (no castling out of check!).
- **En Passant**: No pawn is safe. If a hostile creature leaves your threat range, you may make an Attack of Opportunity against it without using a Reaction. You may use this effect even if the creature uses Disengage or if you've already taken an Attack of Opportunity this round.
- **Fool's Mate**: I can't believe you fell for that! Choose one hostile creature you can see.  
    Make a Deception or Intimidation check, contested by an Insight check made by the target. If you succeed, your attack rolls against the target are made at advantage until the end of the current turn. Has no effect on creatures immune to being charmed (if using Deception) or frightened (if using Intimidation).
