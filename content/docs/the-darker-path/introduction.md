# The Darker Path
A creeping darkness has begun to plague the Central Flanaess, drawing the attention of both commoners and sages alike. In the Free City of Greyhawk, merchants whisper of premium prices being paid for obsidian shards and tarnished artifacts bearing the faintest trace of shadow magic, while in the poor quarter, a charismatic preacher draws growing crowds with sermons about embracing the dark and finding truth in the absence of light. 

What begins as a simple investigation into these seemingly unrelated events will lead adventurers down a path to uncover an ancient force plotting a full invasion of Oerth, where the spreading darkness above is merely an echo of a deeper power to come.

## About the Campaign
The 2024 Dungeon Master's Guide recommends Greyhawk as a suitable starter campaign location. The spirit of that recommendation is to treat Greyhawk as a mostly blank canvas. As a result, the section in Chapter 5 describing Greyhawk is treated as the only canon. Any other content is ignored. This is not your Gygax's Greyhawk for reasons to be revealed during the story.

For anyone without access to lore materials, a short primer is attached. As an introductory exercise, you will asked to point to your character's home or a place you visited in Greyhawk prior to the campaign.
## Your Character in the World
Bring your existing character from Möbius Drip promoted to 4th level, or a fresh 4th level character of your choice. Primary D&D sources are preferred, homebrews require DM approval. Any standard ability score generation method (standard scores, point buy, rolling 4d6) is allowed. 

The Darker Path was intended for player characters who aren't sure which parts of their character they wish to flesh out, and uses a standard "adventuring guild" rallying point for the party as a whole. As relatively low ranking members of the guild, your team will be sent on longer range, lower priority missions at first. This can change as you complete missions and you standing grows. 
## Scheduling
Play sessions will be held one Saturday each month. I will be sharing a calendar shortly.
## Safety Tools and Themes
As benefiting a campaign loosely cobbled together from video game story set pieces, players have three magic safe words that can be used at any time:

**Pause**: Player is willing to continue if they have a breather.

**Skip**: Player can handle it but not the detailed description.

**Reset**: Narrative needs to change immediately to not include something.

Like all "lines and veils" mechanisms, explanation of why something is triggering is limited to the minimum required to avoid triggers.
