#### The Svirfneblin Bag of Crafts 
*Wondrous Item, common*

This bag contains a hefty supply for the crafty adventure. There are 3 different materials that can be pulled out of the bag, each of which can be pulled out once per day. All materials outside the bag lose all magic properties and effects at midnight. 
- **Glimmering Glitter**: You can toss a handful onto a creature or object within 5 ft. If it is a creature or an object being held by a creature, that creature must make a DC15 Dexterity Saving Throw. On a failure, the glitter will stick to the target, and the affected creature or object can’t benefit from being invisible. It takes an hour to remove the Glitter. 
- **Callarduran’s Smooth Glue**: You pull out a handful of glue, which isn’t sticky. When the command word is spoken, the glue immediately becomes sticky. Anything stuck together with this glue can be pulled apart with a successful DC 15 Strength check. 
- **Deep Dye**: You pull out a jar of dye of any one single color. The dye can stain any object, metal, leather, hair, skin, magical item… if you pour it, it will dye. It can be removed over ten minutes by continuously casting Prestidigitation. (Dye coloring does fade after midnight, like all other effects).
