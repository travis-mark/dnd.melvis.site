## Important Names

A handful of important names are defined below:

**Oerth** (pronounced orth or oyth) is the world of Greyhawk. It has four continents, four oceans, and a plethora of islands and seas.

**Oerik** (pronounced or-ick or oy-rick) is one of Oerth’s continents.

**Eastern Oerik**, the vast region explored in this chapter, is home to many powerful nations and some of the D&D game’s most famous dungeons and adventurers.

**The Flanaess** (pronounced flah-nay-ess or flay-nayz) is another name for Eastern Oerik and means “land of the Flan.” The region’s first human settlers and their descendants are known as the Flan.

**The Free City of Greyhawk** is an independent city in Eastern Oerik that attracts large numbers of adventurers. Greyhawk doubles as the name of the campaign setting.

## Greyhawk’s Premise

The year is 576 CY (Common Year). Evil is ascendant across the lands of Eastern Oerik. If something isn’t done to curtail the growing threat, Eastern Oerik will fall to tyrants, evil dragons, and monstrous hordes. Heroes are needed to bring hope to the people of the Flanaess. Even if the heroes die trying, the legends of their exploits will live on!

Adventuring parties from the Free City of Greyhawk and other settlements trek across the vast wilderness of Eastern Oerik, slaying monsters and exploring dungeons to find magic items the adventurers can use to defend their homeland and take the fight to their enemies.
