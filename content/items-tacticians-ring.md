## Tactician's Ring
*Wondrous Item, common*

This ring made of jet and marble is proof that you know how to strategize when everything's on the line.
Once per day, you may activate this ring to use one of the following effects.
- **Castling**: It's time to reposition. Choose one willing creature you can see within 15 feet.  
    You may swap places with that creature as a bonus action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If your movement speed is currently 0, you may not use this effect (no castling out of check!).
- **En Passant**: No pawn is safe. If a hostile creature leaves your threat range, you may make an Attack of Opportunity against it without using a Reaction. You may use this effect even if the creature uses Disengage or if you've already taken an Attack of Opportunity this round.
- **Fool's Mate**: I can't believe you fell for that! Choose one hostile creature you can see.  
    Make a Deception or Intimidation check, contested by an Insight check made by the target. If you succeed, your attack rolls against the target are made at advantage until the end of the current turn. Has no effect on creatures immune to being charmed (if using Deception) or frightened (if using Intimidation).
